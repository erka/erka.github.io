It was the final Saturday of my stay in San Francisco. I had been here for a few weeks, and this was undoubtedly the coldest summer I’d ever experienced. It’s hard to believe that people adapt to these weather conditions, but they do—it’s their normal. I’ve adjusted to it as well, though now it’s almost time to head home. I decided to take one last walk to see the Golden Gate Bridge, the Pacific Ocean, and Marshall Beach. Marshall Beach is easily one of the best spots to admire the bridge and lose yourself in the sound of the Pacific's waves.

I hop on a trolley, transfer to a bus, and ride it to an observation deck near the bridge. The view is stunning, but it’s packed with people. I wander down to Torpedo Wharf to grab a sandwich. There’s only one small café around, and they make a great sandwich. I’ve bought a few from here already, always trying something different. Today is no exception. There’s supposed to be a beautiful sunset tonight...
