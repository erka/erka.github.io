### Background

I have the very old MacBook early 2011 (MacBookPro8,1) which I use time to time. Apple stopped to support this hardware many years ago and it could only run mac OS X 10.13. As time goes the many apps gradually stopped the support this version of the operating system including Slack, Signal, NodeJS, etc. While you still could run older version of Firefox or Chrome the sites also modernize their assets to the point that it's hard to use them. As I have a spare micro sd card I decided to give it a try run linux on this old MacBook.

### University days

When I studied at the university there was a boom of Linux and FreeBSD. Many companies tried to promote their distributions as much as possible. You could order some distribution for free sometimes even with free delivery. I still have memories when you got the pack of five cd disks with all the packages. It was like a gem. In order to install Linux you have to put each of them into the cdrom during the installation process. The fun thing was that the installer told you to insert the disk by number often out of order and sometimes asked for the same disk few times. Probably it depended on the package and its' dependencies. But it was great to have such distribution on the hand as we had very limited Internet connection those days.

For two consequent semesters I run only Linux on my machine. At university we learned a lot of java and it was just perfect for me. I chose to use Debian as it was the most stable distribution at the time. It also had minimalistic requirements for initial setup. I installed it with smallest amount of packages then customize it to my needs. I believe I used `Xfce` or similar desktop manager, `Opera` as the browser of choice because you have great control over the images, `OpenOffice` as office suite. I do forget the IDE I used at that time but it wasn't `Vim` for sure. Anyhow Windows had a lot of issues those days and anyone could do bad things over the network so running Linux was fun. But it required a lot of patient during the installation. As many computers had different components it was a nightmare to get all the drivers for your system. Sometime you had to compile drivers from sources or rebuilt kernel. Other time it was easier to exchange some components with the neighbour to use existing drivers.

Next year the university program had changed dramatically and `.NET` technologies were all over the place. The disk space requirements didn't allowed me to have Windows and Linux side by side so I said good-bye to my Linux setup. I used Windows for few years than switched to Mac OS X and never looked around.
