The "Painted Ladies" are arguably one of San Francisco's iconic landmarks. These six Victorian houses were built between 1892 and 1896, surviving earthquakes and wars. The history of these timber-framed homes, made of redwood, is definitely worth reading.

Today, many tourists visit Alamo Square Park to marvel at the striking contrast between the "Painted Ladies" and the downtown skyscrapers. People come here in the morning, afternoon, and evening. I was no exception. I wanted to capture the classic photo of the houses with the downtown skyline in the background. I have to admit, it took some effort to be in the right place at the right time. The first time I arrived at Alamo Square was at noon, just to scout the area and find the best spot. The next time, I came at the right hour, but the fog rolled in, obscuring everythingâ€”even the houses were barely visible. On my third attempt, I was simply too late, and the sun had already set. The houses were still visible, but the skyscrapers had faded into the twilight. Only on the fourth try did I manage to get something close to that classic shot.

For over a hundred years, the "Painted Ladies" have delighted visitors to Alamo Square Park. I hope they continue to do so for centuries to come.
